# COVID-19-Impact-Analysis
# 🌍 COVID-19 Global Impact Analysis

This project explores the global impact of COVID-19 using a dataset that includes case counts, deaths, and other related statistics by country and date. We performed detailed data cleaning, transformation, visualization, and applied machine learning clustering to identify country groupings based on COVID-19 impact.
